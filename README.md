# Employee Database Web Application
ASP.NET 5 web application, Entity Framework, Google authenticator, Azure SQL, Azure etc.

App published on Azure at https://employeedatabaseapp.azurewebsites.net

Hello, and good day

Here I present a pretty decent web application I have quickly built for demonstration. I will publish it shortly on my Azure and provide the link.

So this app has few things. First, a page on all the major HTML elements, often involved in front-end development. Gives a break down of all the important HTML elements.
Next part, Effects page, goes into CSS, what it is about, and how it works in general, etc. Last part has a Azure SQL-hosted mock employee database, with ability to add, delete employees, modify their details, etc. And search ability.

Authentication implemented, and also Google provider implemented.

Much can be said about web applications. ASP.NET provides an excellent foundation/framework for developing web apps in C#. ASP.NET is used not only in MVC and other web apps, but also in WebAPI's, and also in Blazor. 

In fact, I am currently building a Blazor app, with GraphQL demo. GraphQL is definatly very useful, and almost next-level REST, so I definatly wanted to post a good demo on that. And Blazor is great as well. I will probably also add a 2nd Fetch part, with gRPC imlementation - another interesting microservice architecture.

Just wanted to demonstrate my understanding of web applications, front-end, backend, database operations and migrations, authentication concepts, etc etc.
