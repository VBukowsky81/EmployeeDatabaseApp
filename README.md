# EmployeeDatabaseApp
ASP.NET 5 web application, Entity Framework, Google authenticator, database in Azure SQL, hosted on Azure etc.

Hello, and good day

Here I present a pretty decent web application I have quickly built for demonstration. I will publish it shortly on my Azure and provide the link.

So this app has few things. First, a page on all the major HTML elements, often involved in front-end development. Kinda gives a break down of all the important HTML elements.
Second part has a Azure SQL-hosted mock employee database, with ability to add, delete employees, modify their details, etc. And search ability.

Authentication implemented, and also Google provider implemented.

Just wanted to demonstrate my understanding of web applications, front-end, backend, database operations and migrations, authentication concepts, etc etc.

Thank you!

Vic
